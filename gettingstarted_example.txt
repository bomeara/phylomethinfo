R calls in R markdown go within sections delimited by three backticks (`, the character just to the left of the 1 on US English keyboards; YMMV on other keyboards). For R code to execute, you must include {r} after the first three.

```{r}
2+3
library(ape)
plot(rcoal(5))
```

Look at the Markdown Cheatsheet [PDF](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) for more info.

*To do*

Take the following lines and do what they say.

MAKE THIS LINE BOLD

MAKE THE WORD ITALIC ITALICIZED

MAKE THE FOLLOWING R CODE CREATE A PLOT IN THIS DOCUMENT

plot(density(rnorm(1000)))

### R exercise

Edit this document so that this code all runs properly. You can create the final document by doing `rmarkdown::render("gettingstarted_exercise.Rmd")` in R or hitting the knit button in Rstudio.


```{r}
# Experience with coding.

GetHowManyTrees <- function(ntaxa=10) {
	#ape can compute this for us. help(package="ape") for help on ape.
	result <- ___SOME FUNCTION WITH AN ARGUMENT_____
	return(result)
}
```
